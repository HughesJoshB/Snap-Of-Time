<p>First off my name is Patti Hughes. I was born and raise in Southeastern NC. With having a father that was in the Navy we have lived in Charleston, SC and St. Louis, MO and always called
Brunswick County, NC home. We travelled around to different areas when he was home on leave. With doing so I always took photos to help remember the trips we had as a family.
</p>
<p>In the last few years, I took some classes and began to take landscape 
images of my favorite area, Southeastern NC.  After being a second shooter at several weddings, I began doing small weddings, 
life-style images, and family groups. My grandchildren give me plenty of practice with babies and toddlers. 
</p> 
<p>I’m a native of the area, and photography allows me to pursue my creative outlet from my primary day job as an accountant 
and tax preparer! Contact me for more details and prices.
